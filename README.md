Exoplanet Classification | Solar Power Energy Generation and Carbon Abatement Analysis

## Summary
This repository contains [Bradley Reardon](https://github.com/breardon7), [Pranay](https://github.com/Pranay-yanarp), [Quinyan](https://github.com/xczqy1111), [Jichong Wu](https://github.com/JichongWu), and [Baldur Hua](https://github.com/BaldurHua)'s final projects for George Washington University's DATS 6101: Intro to Data Science course.
The objective for our projects was to apply the statistical and machine learning model techniques we learned in the course to real world problems.

## Project 1 - Solar Power Energy Generation and Carbon Abatement Analysis
In this project, we determined which features affect solar power energy generation and carbon dioxide abatement by running linear regrgession models and ANOVA tests on solar panel data from 7,900 cities in the United States.

## Project 2 - Exoplanet Classification
In this project, we classified 9,872 Kepler Objects of Interst as exoplanets/non-exoplanets using KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models.
